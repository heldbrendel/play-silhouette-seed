# play-silhouette-slick-seed

This is a seed for a Play project that uses silhouette for authentication/authorization and slick for persistence.

Compared to the [mohiva/play-silhouette-seed](https://github.com/mohiva/play-silhouette-seed) this repository
is different with the following points:

- No social auth
- User identification by the username instead of email
- No account activation
- No email sending 
- Slick for persistence instead of in-memory
- PostgreSQL as db backend
- Bulma instead of Bootstrap for user interface
- I18n with English and German
